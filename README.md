## About the Project

This project is an **end-to-end (E2E) data analysis** focused on studying the characteristics and purchasing patterns of customers from a real shopping center (Singapore). Using Python for data processing and analysis, and Quarto for reporting, the goal is to transform raw data into actionable insights to optimize operations, personalize offers, and maximize customer value.

## Technologies and Process

* **Tools**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Quarto (for reporting), Jupyter Notebook/VS Code.
* **Analysis Pipeline**:
    * **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Data loading (`.csv`), exploratory analysis, handling missing values, correcting data types, and outlier removal.
    * **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new features such as Customer Age at Enrollment, Total Spent, Total Purchases, and Presence of Children/Teenagers.
    * **Exploratory Analysis and Visualizations**: Generation of charts (violin plots, distplots, regplots, countplots, pie charts) to understand demographics (age, education, marital status), income and spending patterns, purchasing behavior by country, and registration seasonality.
* **Key Insights**: Identification of target audience (35-45 years old, high education, married), correlation between income/education/spending, predominance of local customers (Singapore) with significant contribution from Saudi Arabia/Canada, and specific purchasing patterns by country.

## Repository Content

## How to View the Complete Analysis

* **Online (HTML)**: Download the `1AnaliseDadosShoppingCenter.html` file from the `quarto/` folder and open it in your browser.
* **Jupyter Notebook**: View the Jupyter Notebook directly on GitHub or download the `.ipynb` file from the `notebooks/` folder and open it in your Jupyter environment.
* **Locally (Quarto)**:
    1.  Download the `1AnaliseDadosShoppingCenter.qmd` file from the `quarto/` folder.
    2.  Ensure you have Quarto and Python with the necessary libraries installed.
    3.  Open the `.qmd` in a compatible editor (VS Code with Quarto extension) and compile it.
